Magic also flows through this conduit from your eidolon into you, so your eidolon determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose from (as described in Summoner Spellcasting on page 54).</p>\n<p>Choose a type of eidolon from the options starting on page 59 and other eidolons you have access to. When you choose your eidolon, you also determine its appearance and general form, within the parameters for that particular type of eidolon. Once you establish your eidolon's type and general appearance, these features can't be changed later, except by selecting special evolution feats that can cause your eidolon to develop new features.</p>\n<p>Your magical connection with your eidolon takes the form of a sigil on each of your bodies. As long as your eidolon is manifested, the sigil glows with light and can't be covered or disguised via any means; it will shine through clothing, appear over cloaks, and remain unaffected by obfuscating magic. This, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you are connected in some way, even if the person has never encountered a summoner before.</p>\n<p>You bring your eidolon into reality with the Manifest Eidolon action.</p>\n<p>Your eidolon is no mere minion. It doesn't have the minion or summoned trait, and the two of you work together and coordinate your actions. You and your eidolon share your actions and multiple attack penalty. Each round, you can use any of your actions (including reactions and free actions) for yourself or your eidolon.</p>\n<p>You coordinate your actions with your eidolon more efficiently when you Act Together. Your connection with your eidolon allows you to communicate with it telepathically at all times, even when it isn't manifested. You also gain the Share Senses action.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the connection between you and your eidolon means you both share a single pool of Hit Points. Damage taken by either you or the eidolon reduces your Hit Points, while healing either of you recovers your Hit Points. Like with your actions, if you and your eidolon are both subject to the same effect that affects your Hit Points, you apply those effects only once (applying the greater effect, if applicable). For instance, if you and your eidolon get caught in an area effect that would heal or damage you both, only the greater amount of healing or damage applies.</p>\n<h3>Gear and your Eidolon</h3>\n<p>Your eidolon can't wear or use magic items, except for items with the eidolon trait. An eidolon can have up to two items invested. Your eidolon's link to you means it can benefit from certain magic items invested by you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your eidolon gains item bonuses to Perception and skills from any magical items that you have invested.</li>\n<li>Your eidolon increases its item bonus to AC based on your armor's armor potency rune or bracers of armor. It also gains an item bonus to its saves from the resilient rune on your armor or from your bracers of armor. Other permanent items that grant or increase item bonuses to AC and saves might convey a similar benefit, as determined by the GM.</li>\n<li>Your eidolon's Strikes benefit from the fundamental and property runes on your handwraps of mighty blows. Alternatively, you can Invest a magic weapon (even though magic weapons can't normally be Invested) to share its fundamental and property runes with your eidolon. You share these benefits only while you're holding the weapon, and you can have no more than one weapon invested in this way at a time. In either case, the eidolon gains only the benefits that can apply to its attacks, with the same limitations noted in handwraps of mighty blows.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lost and Altered Actions</h3>\n<p>If you or your eidolon becomes slowed, stunned, quickened, or otherwise affected by something that changes the actions you gain at the start of each turn, it affects your shared actions. However, if you are both subject to such an effect, apply only the more severe one. For instance, if you or your eidolon were @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}, you would start your turn with one fewer action, but if you were both slowed 1, you would still lose only one action, rather than adding the two slowed effects together. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2}, you'd have two fewer actions, because that's the more severe effect. If only one of you becomes restricted in how you can spend your actions, that restriction doesn't automatically extend to the other; for example, if your eidolon became @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} or petrified, it wouldn't be able to move, but you could still use your actions to move. The GM resolves any situation that's unclear.</p>\n<p>You, as the player, control both your summoner and your eidolon, and the two are generally considered to cooperate unless you decide for them not to. While a summoner's link with an eidolon is a partnership, ultimately the eidolon is linked to you, not the other way around. If there's ever a conflict of who should act, you win out over your eidolon. This means that if the eidolon comes under an effect that would take its actions out of your control, such as the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} or controlled condition, you can use all of your shared actions so your eidolon doesn't have any actions remaining to cause trouble (as long as you are able to act). However, if you came under such an effect, you would simply use all of your shared actions, preventing your eidolon from acting.</p>"},"rules":[{"allowDuplicate":false,"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.n5vwBnLSlIXL9ptp","flag":"manifestEidolon"},{"allowDuplicate":false,"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.2KV87ponbWXgGIhZ","flag":"actTogether"},{"allowDuplicate":false,"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.3ZzoI9MTtJFd1Kjl","flag":"shareSenses"}],"slug":"eidolon","_migration":{"version":0.935,"lastMigration":null,"previous":null},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["summoner"],"rarity":"common"},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder Secrets of Magic","authors":"","license":"OGL","remaster":false},"level":{"value":1},"category":"classfeature","onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":"oBH6XRjhJhAZGHXC"},"type":"feat","_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.qOEpe596B0UjhcG0","duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.7.2","createdTime":1733605993712,"modifiedTime":1733605993712,"lastModifiedBy":"71SxMCtnCABLtFjn"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":400,"ownership":{"default":0,"71SxMCtnCABLtFjn":3},"flags":{"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"manifestEidolon":{"id":"yZlTbjd9vo3XLZQs","onDelete":"detach"},"actTogether":{"id":"OqsnSfG6UnlW3mJg","onDelete":"detach"},"shareSenses":{"id":"xNPkBeXJtYRFaHu3","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"_id":"UKfRmaCZV5cjIScl"},{"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/features/classes/evolution-feat.webp","name":"Evolution Feat","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>Evolution feats are a special type of summoner class feat that allow you to customize your eidolon through your shared link.

The most common deities in Pathfinder appear on pages 35–39 of Player Core, along with their edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a devotee of that deity. Choose one deity.</p><h2>Skill</h2><p>You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. As normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice.</p><h2>Anathema</h2><p>Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table—you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.</p>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual. If your deity doesn't require the specific sanctification you had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and cause while still following the same deity.</p><h2>Sanctification</h2><p>Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.</p>\n<p>If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the deity lists \"none,\" you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you atone.</p>\n<p>Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them. Unholy sanctification and causes are uncommon options.</p>\n<p><strong>Holy:</strong> You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them\" and the anathema \"Commit murder.\" Even if your game includes behavior outside the Pathfinder baseline, the acts listed there are anathema to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Unholy:</strong> You gain the unholy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not put another's needs before your own or those of your deity\" and the anathema \"Commit an entirely altruistic act, such as giving something away in charity\" and \"Put anyone's needs before those of your deity.\" None of these prevents you from performing acts others might consider helpful, but these acts must be done with the expectation that they ultimately further your own goals or those of your

This familiar follows the rules for familiars, though as it's a direct conduit between you and your patron, it's more powerful than typical familiars. Your familiar gains two additional familiar abilities: one of these is a unique ability based on your patron and is always selected, and the other is an additional familiar ability that can be selected daily as normal. Your familiar gains another extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Spells:</strong> Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your witch spellcasting. Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-rank spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's initial lesson. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to. Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Spells:</strong> Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a written version of that spell over the course of 1 hour. This can be a scroll of that spell, or you can prepare a written version using the Learn a Spell exploration activity. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar.</p>\n<p><strong>Undying:</strong> If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless.

You can focus this divine power through special items known as ikons. Ikons are items or bodily features intrinsically linked to you—sacred vessels forged from your divinity that are capable of conducting its power.</p>\n<p>By placing your divine spark into one of your ikons, you empower that ikon to accomplish deeds beyond what it could in mortal hands. Each ikon has both a passive immanence effect and an active transcendence effect. Both of these effects require your divine spark to be in the item. You can place your spark into an ikon by using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.9cGJBXSJW6EpgibP]{Shift Immanence} action.</p><h3>Spark Transcendence</h3><p>While your spark dwells within an ikon, you get that ikon's immanence effect continually. However, you can also Spark Transcendence in a mighty deed, channeling your divinity through the ikon—though when you Spark Transcendence, the force of the act temporarily casts your divine spark out of the ikon. Each ikon's transcendence action appears in its stat block, and the transcendence trait is described in the Key Terms sidebar.</p><h3>Expanding <strong>Immanence</strong> And Transcendence</h3><p>Each ikon has one immanence and one transcendence ability when acquired, but you can imbue your ikons with additional abilities through higher-level exemplar class features and feats. These abilities have the ikon trait.</p><h2>Ikons</h2><p>As an exemplar, you select three ikons at first level. Typically, you will want to ensure at least one of your ikons is a weapon. Body ikons accentuate a physical trait of your body and so can't be stolen, disarmed, dispelled, or otherwise taken away. Weapon and worn ikons are tied to items of power. When you select one, you gain a non-magical, level-0 item of your choice that matches its usage entry. Providence ensures you come across these items; you might be traveling along a path to find a spear in a tree that only you can dislodge, or you might awaken holding a gleaming sash you saw in your dreams.</p>\n<p>Your ikons can be etched with runes, upgraded, or otherwise modified as normal for items of their type. A body or worn ikon can have runes etched on it to apply to your unarmed attacks as though it were handwraps of mighty blows, though only one of your ikons can have these runes and no ikon can have both these and armor or weapon runes.</p>\n<p>If you acquire a new item the ikon's usage could apply to, you can switch your ikon to the new item by spending 1 day of downtime with the new ikon as you saturate the object with your divine energy. You can use this process to make an existing magic item, like a cloak of illusions or a searing blade, into your ikon. If the item wasn't already a divine item, it becomes one for as long as it is your ikon, removing the arcane, occult, primal, or magical trait from the item and adding the divine trait. Artifacts, intelligent items, and other similarly powerful objects might resist your attempts to exert your divinity over them, with unpredictable results determined by the GM.</p>"},"rules":[{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.9cGJBXSJW6EpgibP","flag":"shiftImmanence"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":["item:tag:exemplar-ikon"]},"flag":"firstIkon","key":"ChoiceSet","prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Exemplar.Ikon.Prompt","selection":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.pHUi7KCh1DH5pxMe"},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.firstIkon}","flag":"victorsWreath"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":["item:tag:exemplar-ikon"]},"flag":"secondIkon","key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":["class:exemplar"],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Exemplar.Ikon.Prompt"},{"key":"GrantItem","predicate":["class:exemplar"],"uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.secondIkon}"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":["item:tag:exemplar-ikon"]},"flag":"thirdIkon","key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":["class:exemplar"],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Exemplar.Ikon.Prompt"},{"key":"GrantItem","predicate":["class:exemplar"],"uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.thirdIkon}"},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"flags.pf2e.exemplar.ikons","priority":10,"value":[]}],"slug":"divine-spark-and-ikons","_migration":{"version":0.935,"lastMigration":null,"previous":null},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["exemplar"],"rarity":"common"},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder War of Immortals","authors":"","license":"ORC","remaster":true},"level":{"value":1},"category":"classfeature","onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":null},"type":"feat","_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.GtxSH6TudkQoKToW","duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.8.0","createdTime":1734831720097,"modifiedTime":1734831720097,"lastModifiedBy":"1cwCcjdVjzW7kGi4"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"1cwCcjdVjzW7kGi4":3},"flags":{"pf2e":{"grantedBy":{"id":"N1JvjrwMxotCKsgj","onDelete":"cascade"},"itemGrants":{"shiftImmanence":{"id":"uuAfhry99h54H6u0","onDelete":"detach"},"victorsWreath":{"id":"6fdtiBbX6pRDuuvV","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"_id":"J2USuR4OZL4WcuQO"},{"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/actions/OneAction.webp","name":"Shift Immanence","system":{"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actions":{"value":1},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p><hr /><p>You shift your power, filling one of your ikons with your divine spark.
