Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea. Human characters can be any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Human Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Two free ability boosts</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

If it's turned inside out, the items inside spill out unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. A living creature placed inside the bag has enough air for 10 minutes before it begins to suffocate, and it can attempt to Escape against a DC of 13. An item inside the bag provides no benefits unless it's retrieved first.

This familiar follows the rules for familiars, though as it's a direct conduit between you and your patron, it's more powerful than typical familiars. Your familiar gains two additional familiar abilities: one of these is a unique ability based on your patron and is always selected, and the other is an additional familiar ability that can be selected daily as normal. Your familiar gains another extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Spells:</strong> Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your witch spellcasting. Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-rank spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's initial lesson. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to. Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Spells:</strong> Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a written version of that spell over the course of 1 hour. This can be a scroll of that spell, or you can prepare a written version using the Learn a Spell exploration activity. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar.</p>\n<p><strong>Undying:</strong> If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless.

When you Cast this Spell, pick one of the following triggers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target moves more than its Speed in a single round.</li>\n<li>The target makes more than one Strike in a single round.</li>\n<li>The target Casts a Spell.</li>\n<li>The target uses a specific skill you name.</li>\n<li>The target uses a specific ability you name.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the target takes the triggering action, the portent of doom activates-the sword strikes down, the noose loops around the target's neck, the skull bares its fangs-and the target takes @Damage[70[mental]] damage with a basic Reflex save. The target instinctively knows which action will trigger the omen and can ward off the omen by spending a total of 3 actions, which have the concentrate trait, to pray, make signs against doom, or similar apotropaic actions. These actions need not be consecutive. After the creature spends the actions, the spell ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 10.</p>"},"rules":[],"slug":"suspended-retribution","_migration":{"version":0.935,"lastMigration":null,"previous":{"schema":0.934,"foundry":"12.331","system":"6.7.1"}},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["concentrate","curse","manipulate","mental","prediction"],"rarity":"common","traditions":["divine","occult"]},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder Dark Archive","authors":"","license":"OGL","remaster":false},"level":{"value":6},"requirements":"","target":{"value":"1 creature"},"range":{"value":"60 feet"},"area":null,"time":{"value":"2"},"duration":{"value":"1 minute","sustained":false},"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":true,"statistic":"reflex"}},"cost":{"value":""},"location":{"value":"L23ZZa1v2nxGcvUb","signature":true},"counteraction":false,"heightening":{"damage":{},"interval":1,"type":"interval"}},"type":"spell","_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.k0qJfSZH5xUEggwU","duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.330","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.2.0","createdTime":1722794670989,"modifiedTime":1722795592855,"lastModifiedBy":"s4dpkteY6EHat95Y"},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.k0qJfSZH5xUEggwU"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"s4dpkteY6EHat95Y":3}},{"_id":"FiSLPcx0EQseoUIr","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/spells/phantom-orchestra.webp","name":"Phantom Orchestra","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>You orchestrate an invisible ensemble of lost sounds captured inside errant breezes across the Plane of Air, and you can direct this symphony to attack foes within range.

To them, fury isn't just an emotion— it's a supernatural state that channels old and deep spells through their blood. The bloodrager's magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess. You must select Bloodrager Dedication as your 2nd-level class feat.</p><p><strong>Anathema</strong> Denying the power of your blood or allowing others to degrade your magic is anathema to you.</p><p><strong>Bloodline:</strong> Choose a sorcerer bloodline. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity, and spells you gain from this class archetype and its feats gain the Rage trait. You're trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for your tradition's spells. You become an expert at 9th level, and a master at 17th level. Your key spellcasting ability for bloodrager spells is Intelligence. You treat your bloodline spells as if they were spells of your tradition for the purpose of learning new spells. You don't gain any other abilities from your choice of bloodline.</p><p><strong>Bloodrager Spellcasting</strong> Your bloodline provides you with limited control over magic. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a bloodrager, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a material component pouch. Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell and three cantrips. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell . As you increase in level as a barbarian, the magic in your veins grants you additional, more powerful spell slots. Your total number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast are shown in Table 2-2: Bloodrager Spells per Day. Because of how much magic energy is expelled during your bloodrages, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest level and, if you can cast 2nd-level spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 level lower than your highest spell level. You can still gain additional spell slots via feats granted by this archetype.</p><p><strong>Spell Repertoire</strong> The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and three cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it doesn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2–4: Bloodrager Spells per Day), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell. At 3rd level, you add the first 2nd-level spell to your repertoire. At 4th level you gain your second and your spell repertoire reaches its maximum size of five spells. At 5th level, in addition to adding two 3rd-level spells to your repertoire, you lose your lowest level of spell slots. Any time you lose a level of spell slots, you lose two spells in your repertoire as well. These can come from spells you already know or out of the number of new spells you're learning. On levels in which you don't change your spell slots, you can swap out multiple spells, as described below.</p><p><strong>Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire</strong> As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. If it's a level at which you lose a set of lower-level slots, you can replace the two in either order. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime. At 6th level and every even level thereafter, you can swap out any number of your spells for different spells of a level you can cast. When you do, you must keep at least one spell you can cast with your lowest level of spell slots so you don't end up with slots you can't use.
