For example, if you were making a morningstar and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2e\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Specialty</th>\n<th>Applicable Items</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Alchemy*</td>\n<td>Alchemical items such as elixirs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Artistry</td>\n<td>Fine art, including jewelry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blacksmithing</td>\n<td>Durable metal goods, including metal armor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bookmaking</td>\n<td>Books and paper</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Glassmaking</td>\n<td>Glass, including glassware and windows</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Leatherworking</td>\n<td>Leather goods, including leather armor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pottery</td>\n<td>Ceramic goods</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shipbuilding</td>\n<td>Ships and boats</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stonemasonry</td>\n<td>Stone goods and structures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tailoring</td>\n<td>Clothing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weaving</td>\n<td>Textiles, baskets, and rugs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Woodworking</td>\n<td>Wooden goods and structures</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>* You must have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.is3Oz9wt11lNq62K]{Alchemical Crafting} skill feat to Craft alchemical items.</p>"},"rules":[{"choices":[{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SpecialtyCrafting.Alchemy","predicate":[{"not":"feat:specialty-crafting:alchemy"}],"value":"alchemy"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SpecialtyCrafting.Artistry","predicate":[{"not":"feat:specialty-crafting:artistry"}],"value":"artistry"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SpecialtyCrafting.Blacksmithing","predicate":[{"not":"feat:specialty-crafting:blacksmithing"}],"value":"blacksmithing"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SpecialtyCrafting.Bookmaking","predicate":[{"not":"feat:specialty-crafting:bookmaking"}],"value":"bookmaking"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SpecialtyCrafting.Glassmaking","predicate":[{"not":"feat:specialty-crafting:glassmaking"}],"value":"glassmaking"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SpecialtyCrafting.Leatherworking","predicate":[{"not":"feat:specialty-crafting:leatherworking"}],"value":"leatherworking"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SpecialtyCrafting.Pottery","predicate":[{"not":"feat:specialty-crafting:pottery"}],"value":"pottery"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SpecialtyCrafting.Shipbuilding","predicate":[{"not":"feat:specialty-crafting:shipbuilding"}],"value":"shipbuilding"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SpecialtyCrafting.Stonemasonry","predicate":[{"not":"feat:specialty-crafting:stonemasonry"}],"value":"stonemasonry"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SpecialtyCrafting.Tailoring","predicate":[{"not":"feat:specialty-crafting:tailoring"}],"value":"tailoring"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SpecialtyCrafting.Weaving","predicate":[{"not":"feat:specialty-crafting:weaving"}],"value":"weaving"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SpecialtyCrafting.Woodworking","predicate":[{"not":"feat:specialty-crafting:woodworking"}],"value":"woodworking"}],"flag":"specialtyCrafting","key":"ChoiceSet","prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SpecialtyCrafting.Prompt","rollOption":"feat:specialty-crafting","selection":"blacksmithing"},{"key":"FlatModifier","predicate":["action:craft","{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.specialtyCrafting}"],"selector":"crafting","type":"circumstance","value":{"brackets":[{"end":4,"start":3,"value":2},{"end":2,"start":1,"value":1}],"field":"actor|system.skills.crafting.rank"}}],"slug":"specialty-crafting","_migration":{"version":0.935,"lastMigration":null,"previous":{"schema":0.934,"foundry":"12.331","system":"6.7.1"}},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["general","skill"],"rarity":"common"},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder Player Core","authors":"","license":"ORC","remaster":true},"level":{"value":1},"category":"skill","onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[{"value":"trained in Crafting"}]},"location":"skill-2"},"type":"feat","_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.QLeMH5mQgh28sa5o","duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.330","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.1.3","createdTime":1722466382246,"modifiedTime":1722466382419,"lastModifiedBy":"71SxMCtnCABLtFjn"},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.QLeMH5mQgh28sa5o"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"71SxMCtnCABLtFjn":3}},{"_id":"yJeor6Kpa8cAxGUl","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/core/icons/sundries/books/book-red-exclamation.webp","name":"Pistol Twirl","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You're wielding a loaded one-handed ranged weapon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your quick gestures and flair for performance distract your opponent, leaving it vulnerable to your follow-up attacks.

You can focus this divine power through special items known as ikons. Ikons are items or bodily features intrinsically linked to you—sacred vessels forged from your divinity that are capable of conducting its power.</p>\n<p>By placing your divine spark into one of your ikons, you empower that ikon to accomplish deeds beyond what it could in mortal hands. Each ikon has both a passive immanence effect and an active transcendence effect. Both of these effects require your divine spark to be in the item. You can place your spark into an ikon by using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.9cGJBXSJW6EpgibP]{Shift Immanence} action.</p><h3>Spark Transcendence</h3><p>While your spark dwells within an ikon, you get that ikon's immanence effect continually. However, you can also Spark Transcendence in a mighty deed, channeling your divinity through the ikon—though when you Spark Transcendence, the force of the act temporarily casts your divine spark out of the ikon. Each ikon's transcendence action appears in its stat block, and the transcendence trait is described in the Key Terms sidebar.</p><h3>Expanding <strong>Immanence</strong> And Transcendence</h3><p>Each ikon has one immanence and one transcendence ability when acquired, but you can imbue your ikons with additional abilities through higher-level exemplar class features and feats. These abilities have the ikon trait.</p><h2>Ikons</h2><p>As an exemplar, you select three ikons at first level. Typically, you will want to ensure at least one of your ikons is a weapon. Body ikons accentuate a physical trait of your body and so can't be stolen, disarmed, dispelled, or otherwise taken away. Weapon and worn ikons are tied to items of power. When you select one, you gain a non-magical, level-0 item of your choice that matches its usage entry. Providence ensures you come across these items; you might be traveling along a path to find a spear in a tree that only you can dislodge, or you might awaken holding a gleaming sash you saw in your dreams.</p>\n<p>Your ikons can be etched with runes, upgraded, or otherwise modified as normal for items of their type. A body or worn ikon can have runes etched on it to apply to your unarmed attacks as though it were handwraps of mighty blows, though only one of your ikons can have these runes and no ikon can have both these and armor or weapon runes.</p>\n<p>If you acquire a new item the ikon's usage could apply to, you can switch your ikon to the new item by spending 1 day of downtime with the new ikon as you saturate the object with your divine energy. You can use this process to make an existing magic item, like a cloak of illusions or a searing blade, into your ikon. If the item wasn't already a divine item, it becomes one for as long as it is your ikon, removing the arcane, occult, primal, or magical trait from the item and adding the divine trait. Artifacts, intelligent items, and other similarly powerful objects might resist your attempts to exert your divinity over them, with unpredictable results determined by the GM.</p>"},"rules":[{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.9cGJBXSJW6EpgibP","flag":"shiftImmanence"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":["item:tag:exemplar-ikon"]},"flag":"firstIkon","key":"ChoiceSet","prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Exemplar.Ikon.Prompt","selection":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.ndSCXO9Dg57fmZIY"},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.firstIkon}","flag":"nobleBranch"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":["item:tag:exemplar-ikon"]},"flag":"secondIkon","key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":["class:exemplar"],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Exemplar.Ikon.Prompt","selection":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.LC8i3ZJjhhKEHSLI"},{"key":"GrantItem","predicate":["class:exemplar"],"uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.secondIkon}","flag":"starshot"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":["item:tag:exemplar-ikon"]},"flag":"thirdIkon","key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":["class:exemplar"],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Exemplar.Ikon.Prompt","selection":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Jm8L7uSM01pJxSiW"},{"key":"GrantItem","predicate":["class:exemplar"],"uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.thirdIkon}","flag":"unfailingBow"},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"flags.pf2e.exemplar.ikons","priority":10,"value":[]}],"slug":"divine-spark-and-ikons","_migration":{"version":0.935,"lastMigration":null,"previous":{"schema":0.934,"foundry":"12.331","system":"6.7.1"}},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["exemplar"],"rarity":"common"},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder War of Immortals","authors":"","license":"ORC","remaster":true},"level":{"value":1},"category":"classfeature","onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":"MMKJD0LAB3hTnPks"},"type":"feat","_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.GtxSH6TudkQoKToW","duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.7.0","createdTime":1732654182601,"modifiedTime":1732654182601,"lastModifiedBy":"Ece5NzYBCVQY4aVi"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":400,"ownership":{"default":0,"Ece5NzYBCVQY4aVi":3},"flags":{"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"shiftImmanence":{"id":"Dbx0cwm4HbNaIzPY","onDelete":"detach"},"nobleBranch":{"id":"V4AEcvhFS7iHm0Rx","onDelete":"detach"},"starshot":{"id":"rSGbSbLys0xSYSjH","onDelete":"detach"},"unfailingBow":{"id":"kuZNaEypyJe8iKAJ","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"_id":"axepCotjdDYZyTMb"},{"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/core/icons/commodities/treasure/token-engraved-green-glowing.webp","name":"Root Epithet","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>As your story unfolds, your personality and deeds begin to shape the potential of your divine spark.
