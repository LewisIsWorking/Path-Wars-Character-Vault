Birth Year is 4686.</strong></p><p><strong>4686 AR, age 0:</strong> Born aboard the Starship Lagrange to the Lashunta first mate Cmdr. Keiko Sall and human Science Officer Lt. Hebron Sall. Grand celebration for the starship. Keiko returned from leave within 3 months. Kaeda under care of father and nursery staff.</p><p><strong>4690 AR, age 4:</strong> Enrolled in an advanced studies program due to expected genetic superiority. Quickly fell behind classmates, even at a young age. </p><p><strong>4693 AR, age 7:</strong> Father contracted for a year of shore leave to work on a private science venture (genetic studies with Lashunta gene splicing, venture failed). Keiko remained on starship with mother, despite Keiko not having time for watching a child on top of duties. Kaeda under supervision and care of the teachers and after-school programs. Continued to fall behind in studies. Moved to normal program instead of advanced.</p><p><strong>4694 AR, age 8:</strong> Father returned to ship on conclusion of failed scientific venture. Due to financial status being in shambles, is forced to work overtime. Keiko becomes more estranged from parents, barely even sees them. Father takes news of her demotion from advanced program quite harshly. </p><p><strong>4698 AR, age 12:</strong> Kaeda remains behind on Absalom Station as the starship takes off. It takes the ship one month to return, as her absence was only noticed when she missed the start of a new school term. Lived among various locals enjoying her freedom and drifting between places. Was picked up by authorities after a couple weeks, but refused to give them her name. Eventually she was tracked down based on migration logs, around the same time the Starship Lagrange returned. Delivered to the first mate in shackles. Keiko Sall received a formal reprimand.</p><p><strong>4702 AR, age 16:</strong> Begins a piloting program with her classmates. Finally finds something she's decently good at. On a test run, she is the mock captain of a shuttle and successfully pilots a mission with planned mission-critical failures. Two weeks later, is caught taking the same shuttle on an unscheduled run with a male human (name redacted) of the same age. Camera logs were purged for legal reasons. Shuttle returned unharmed. Reprimand issued. </p><p><strong>4704 AR, age 18:</strong> Completes the Lashunta Rite of Majority. The next morning, steals a shuttle and leaves the Starship Lagrange. Mother refused pursuit, claiming she would return when she wished. Two months later, a woman matching Kaeda's description enrolls in Sarass Kamila's escort order as an apprentice. Shows extreme promise.</p><p><strong>4706 AR, age 20:</strong> Completes basic apprenticeship as an escort, begins specialization with musical expertise and dominatrix studies. Kamila notes a high devotion to the order, likely through misplaced emotional attachment. </p><p><strong>4708 AR, age 24:</strong> Graduates from Kamila's order with honors, and is sent to Absalom Station (assumed) to find her first escort job.</p>","birthPlace":"Starship Lagrange","attitude":"Optimistic, freedom-loving, indulgent","beliefs":"Everyone's beliefs are important to them.","anathema":[],"edicts":["Everything in service of pleasure.

You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. Your choice of conscious mind also grants you additional spells in your repertoire, starting with an additional 1st-rabk spell and two cantrips listed in your conscious mind, which you cast as psi cantrips.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select one 2nd-level spell, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Your conscious mind also adds additional spells to your repertoire as you gain spells of higher levels.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, such as the spells you gain from your conscious mind, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<p><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></p>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p><hr /><p><strong>Sorcerer</strong> The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see the Sorcerer Spells per Day table above), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. When you gain a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always the sorcerous gift spell for that rank that's listed in your bloodline, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate.

You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p><hr /><p><strong>Summoner</strong> The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your eidolon, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it doesn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2–4: Summoner Spells per Day), you add a spell of the same rank to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell. At 3rd level, you add the first 2nd-rank spell to your repertoire. At 4th level you gain your second and your spell repertoire reaches its maximum size of five spells.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, in addition to adding two 3rd-rank spells to your repertoire, you lose your lowest rank of spell slots. Any time you lose a rank of spell slots, you lose two spells in your repertoire as well. These can come from spells you already know or out of the number of new spells you're learning. On levels in which you don't change your spell slots, you can swap out multiple spells, as described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></p>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. If it's a rank at which you lose a set of lower-rank slots, you can replace the two in either order. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<p>At 6th level and every even level thereafter, you can swap out any number of your spells for different spells of a rank you can cast. When you do, you must keep at least one spell you can cast with your lowest rank of spell slots so you don't end up with slots you can't use. For instance, at 6th level you would need to keep at least one 2nd-rank spell, but all your other spells could be 3rd rank.</p>"},"rules":[{"itemId":"{item|id}","key":"ItemAlteration","mode":"override","property":"description","value":[{"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.{actor|class.slug}.PartOne"},{"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.{actor|class.slug}.PartTwo"},{"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.{actor|class.slug}.PartThree"},{"divider":true,"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.SpellSwapping"},{"text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.ClassFeatures.SpellRepertoire.{actor|class.slug}.SpellSwapping"}]},{"itemId":"{item|id}","key":"ItemAlteration","mode":"add","property":"traits","value":"{actor|class.slug}"}],"slug":"spell-repertoire","_migration":{"version":0.935,"lastMigration":null,"previous":null},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["bard","oracle","psychic","sorcerer","summoner"],"rarity":"common"},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder Player Core","authors":"","license":"ORC","remaster":true},"level":{"value":1},"category":"classfeature","onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":"iI4VS5lWDue6ZkPE"},"type":"feat","_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.1RfnAiyQ5FR7vnuH","duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.8.4","createdTime":1737728354544,"modifiedTime":1737728354544,"lastModifiedBy":"Wy2h2hPOnLciDtaM"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":300,"ownership":{"default":0,"Wy2h2hPOnLciDtaM":3},"flags":{},"_id":"yUMR6fprXWqNIEvJ"},{"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/core/icons/tools/instruments/pipe-flue-tan.webp","name":"Composition Spells","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>You can infuse your performances with magic to create unique effects called compositions.
