originally synonymous with a jail or prison, the word \"dungeon\" has come to mean something altogether more dangerous and expansive. Ancient labyrinths filled with puzzles, traps, and monsters, mystical towers stretching into the sky above, cavern systems echoing with the sounds of distant danger; all of these and more are considered dungeons. A dungeon has come to mean just about any natural or artificial complex full of treasures and dangers. But to you, a dungeon means even more than that. A dungeon is also who you are...</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While most dungeons, no matter how magical, are nothing more than buildings or natural formations, some dungeons are special. Through a set of strange circumstances, sometimes a dungeon awakens to sentience, and then to full sapience, after gaining a life force and soul. This could have been something the dungeon gained on its own, as an aftereffect of either the spirit of the dungeon's builder or vitae (\"so-called nature spirits\") for natural dungeons. Alternatively, it could have happened when the dungeon's core, heart, or focal point absorbed the life force and spirit of an adventuring interloper or dungeon denizen. However a dungeon's awakening occurred, an awakened dungeon is a living, albeit unusual, creature, with an enormous body shaped out of stone or other material and arteries and veins made up of magical conduits or ley lines.</p>\n<p>Of course, awakened dungeons can't get much done outside of their own environs if they leave it at that. So eventually, each awakened dungeon becomes able to manifest an avatar; it's a rite of passage for awakened dungeons, similar to reaching adulthood for other creatures. This avatar is formed from the dungeon's core and appears to be a member of a humanoid ancestry. At the same time, the awakened dungeon becomes extradimensional, if it wasn't already, inextricably linking access to the dungeon to the avatar's whims. A dungeon's avatar can even leave the dungeon and explore the world, much like any other character.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is also secretly (or overtly) a dungeon that only you, and the ones you choose, can enter, you should play a dungeon...</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Be extremely interested in learning about the architectural styles and aesthetics of other dungeons, even blushing at times when you see an extremely beautifully designed dungeon.</li>\n<li>Treat even unawakened dungeons with great respect, glaring at comrades whose solution to a maze is to bash down the wall with an adamantine pickaxe. You never know if the dungeon will awaken later, and it's just good manners.</li>\n<li>At times seem distant and detached to others who are used to thinking as a single person, rather than an entire dungeon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't realize that your avatar isn't just \"you\" without being reminded constantly.</li>\n<li>Are highly confused when you try to tell them that you are really a dungeon, even after an explanation.</li>\n<li>Appreciate the hidden mysteries you show them, once you trust them enough to let them in.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Dungeon avatars look like normal members of the ancestry they appear to be, though there is usually an unusual feature or two that gives a hint as to the true nature of the dungeon within. As to the dungeons themselves, their physical appearances vary dramatically between heritages, and even within the same heritage, from dungeon to dungeon. No two are alike.</p>\n<h2>The Dungeon Within</h2>\n<p>An awakened dungeon is composed of several progressively more challenging layers, which are called \"floors\" even if they aren't arranged as floors in a traditional sense (such as for an archipelago dungeon, where they are islands). In order to complete the dungeon, an adventurer must complete each of the floors in order, earning rewards as they do so. For most awakened dungeons, the floors are reflective of some aspect of the dungeon's inner self, soul, hidden past, or some other secret. Whether the dungeon manifested a personality first, and the floors changed to suit their inner self, or whether their inner self was shaped by the floors, is a question as difficult to determine as the chicken and the egg.</p>\n<p>An awakened dungeon can send their avatar in and out of their own extradimensional dungeon in order to challenge a floor of the dungeon through a process that takes an hour of concentration. They can additionally bring along allies, as long as they are all holding hands or otherwise physically connected in a circle throughout the process. It's always possible to leave the dungeon in this way, but the ability to enter is much more limited. Normally, a dungeon and their allies can only enter the dungeon to challenge one of the floors from a safe, stable location after a full day of rest. The GM might determine that the dungeon's avatar is able to enter the dungeon in other circumstances as well. After spending an hour retreating and leaving the dungeon, or after clearing a dungeon floor, an awakened dungeon and any allies they brought are sent back to the same spot where they entered the dungeon. Additionally, if you die, the dungeon loses all consciousness and ejects your remaining allies, as well as your avatar's corpse, back to the Material Plane.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Dungeons can be of any alignment, and their alignment is usually completely unrelated to the alignment of any monsters within the dungeon. If they obtained their life force and spirit from another creature, they often have an alignment similar to that creature. This is especially true if they unlock more of their previous self by clearing floors.</p>\n<p>Similarly, dungeons worship all sorts of deities for all sorts of reasons. Depending on the type of dungeon, natural dungeons might have a slight tendency to worship a nature deity, and artificial dungeons might lean towards a deity associated with doorways, thresholds, transitions, or crafting. Tower dungeons might worship a deity of knowledge, and labyrinth dungeons might worship a deity of tricks and riddles.</p>\n<h2>Name</h2>\n<p>Dungeons have three major tendencies when it comes to names. They typically either keep the name that others commonly called the dungeon before they awakened, give themselves a mighty and impressive sounding dungeon name, or adopt a name more suited to their avatar's form.</p>\n<h2>Sample Names</h2>\n<p>Acheron, Elysia, Hal, Gehenna, Portia, Steve, The Azure Depths, The Crystalline Caverns, The Great Sage Tree, The Twisting Labyrinth.</p>"},"rules":[],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.935,"lastMigration":null,"previous":{"schema":0.935,"foundry":"12.331","system":"6.7.2"}},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":[],"rarity":"rare"},"publication":{"title":"Battlezoo Ancestries: Dungeons","authors":"","license":"OGL","remaster":false},"hp":10,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["con"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"],"selected":"str"}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["chthonian","aklo","empyrean","draconic","dwarven","elven","fey","diabolic"],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"low-light-vision"},"ownership":{"default":0,"SJBWQ2yDJjdAEBHl":3,"Xh8UkORKyRRJwZu0":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.11.5","coreVersion":"12.327","createdTime":1662600258432,"modifiedTime":1704581324075,"lastModifiedBy":"Xh8UkORKyRRJwZu0","compendiumSource":"Item.v7yxjKf5jFRHZKBR","duplicateSource":null},"_id":"bzsjgHwCX0Fnk11K"},{"name":"Tower","type":"heritage","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/spells/discern-location.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.battlezoo-ancestries-dungeons-pf2e.pf2e-battlezoo-dungeon-heritages.Item.Y213GYCO9MsiPdqC"},"LocknKey":{"IDKeysFlag":"","RemoveKeyonUseFlag":false,"LPFormulaFlag":"","LPFormulaOverrideFlag":false,"LBFormulaFlag":"","LBFormulaOverrideFlag":false,"ReplacementItemFlag":""}},"system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>You are a giant tower that pierces the sky of your extradimensional home, with ever-ascending floors full of unusual magic.

Spellcasting","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>Through dedicated study and practice, you can construct spells with academic rigor by shaping arcane magic. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h2>Spellbook</h2>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Tome of Silent Shadows</em> or something more academic, like <em>Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory</em>.</p>\n<p>The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school).</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to and learn via Learn a Spell. When you gain spell slots of a new rank, you also add an additional spell from your school's curriculum (unless it's the school of unified magical theory).</p>"},"rules":[{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz","flag":"castASpell"}],"slug":"wizard-spellcasting","_migration":{"version":0.935,"lastMigration":null,"previous":{"schema":0.935,"foundry":"12.331","system":"6.7.2"}},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["wizard"],"rarity":"common","selected":{}},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder Player Core","authors":"","license":"ORC","remaster":true},"level":{"value":1},"category":"classfeature","onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":"YI358dP6LjmQexk6"},"type":"feat","_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.S6WW4Yyg4XonXGHD","duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.2.2","createdTime":1724007731736,"modifiedTime":1724007731736,"lastModifiedBy":"mbblqnGJEWUAQNoo"},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.S6WW4Yyg4XonXGHD"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"castASpell":{"id":"dbu3yUziT4BAkQim","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"mbblqnGJEWUAQNoo":3},"_id":"aJZYaVNELb65ZsKD"},{"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/core/icons/sundries/scrolls/scroll-writing-tan-grey.webp","name":"Arcane Thesis","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>During your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research.

Some feats let you affect more creatures.</p>\n<p>Reach: The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, shocking grasp would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with reach, and ray of frost would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Ancillary Effects</strong> Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and tanglefoot's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Defenses</strong> Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones. Invalid or Immune Target: If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Variable Actions</strong> Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take exactly 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Metamagic</strong> You typically can't use metamagic with Spellstrike because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.</p>"},"rules":[{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.QDW9H8XLIjuW2fE4","flag":"spellstrike"}],"slug":"spellstrike","_migration":{"version":0.935,"lastMigration":null,"previous":{"schema":0.935,"foundry":"12.331","system":"6.7.2"}},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["magus"],"rarity":"common"},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder Secrets of Magic","authors":"","license":"OGL","remaster":false},"level":{"value":1,"taken":6},"category":"classfeature","onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":"classfeature"},"type":"feat","_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.KVj5ofUwu3VJSrVw","duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.2.2","createdTime":1724020577380,"modifiedTime":1724020577380,"lastModifiedBy":"mbblqnGJEWUAQNoo"},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.KVj5ofUwu3VJSrVw"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"spellstrike":{"id":"w8PxzyKOWwVX5uBZ","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"mbblqnGJEWUAQNoo":3}},{"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/actions/TwoActions.webp","name":"Spellstrike","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p><strong>Frequency</strong> until recharged (see below)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You channel a spell into a punch or sword thrust to deliver a combined attack.
