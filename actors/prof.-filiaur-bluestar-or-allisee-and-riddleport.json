You can apply special runesmith runes onto objects and creatures, which grant the bearer magical effects. You must know a rune to use it, and you learn runes via the runic repertoire class feature.</p><h3>Applying Runes</h3><p>All runes can be applied in one of two ways: a rune can be etched on or merely traced. An etched rune is carved, inked, or branded in, though this application does not damage the creature or item. Etching runes requires an artisan's toolkit. Your magic can sustain up to 2 etched runes at a time, and you can etch any number of runes up to this maximum during your daily preparations and when you spend 10 minutes in exploration mode. As you increase in level, the maximum amount of etched runes you can have at a given time increases. Your etched runes remain indefinitely until they're expended or removed, or until you etch more runes than your maximum, which causes your oldest rune to fade.</p><p>A traced rune is drawn lightly in dust, light, or a similar fleeting medium. You can trace runes with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-playtest-data.impossible-playtest-actions.Item.wamCImlN6xwUHzyk]{Trace Rune} action.</p><h3>Invoking Runes</h3><p>Magic on your lips, you can pronounce the true name of a rune you have applied, calling it to power using invocation actions. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-playtest-data.impossible-playtest-actions.Item.ozrq9hAuigjzwe9C]{Invoke Rune} invocation action.</p><h3>Runic Magic</h3><p>Runes are magical effects. Some runes have a specific tradition trait; for instance, the elemental ranshu, rune of thunder is a primal rune. Any rune that doesn't have a specific tradition trait can be written in the style of one of the four magical traditions to give it that trait if you are trained in that tradition's skill (for instance, you could create an arcane pluuna, rune of illumination if you were trained in Arcana). Any runes that require a saving throw use your runesmith class DC.</p><p>Though runes aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect runes. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to tracing or invoking runes, though you can continue to benefit from a rune's effects.</p><p>Any rune you use is the same level you are. For instance, if you're 5th level, your runes would be 5th level (and their counteract rank would be 3rd rank), even if you gained the rune at 1st level. Similar to spells, many runes get more powerful as you increase in level. In these cases, the rune ends with one or more \"Level\" entries. This either lists the levels at which the rune gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level rune with a \"Level (+4)\" entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>"},"rules":[{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-playtest-data.impossible-playtest-actions.Item.wamCImlN6xwUHzyk","flag":"traceRune"},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-playtest-data.impossible-playtest-actions.Item.ozrq9hAuigjzwe9C","flag":"invokeRune"}],"slug":null,"_migration":{"version":0.935,"lastMigration":null},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["runesmith"],"rarity":"common"},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder Impossible Playtest","authors":"","license":"ORC","remaster":true},"level":{"value":1},"category":"classfeature","onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":"ADSFx6Ws5ucaBsbJ"},"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/core/icons/magic/symbols/rune-sigil-black-pink.webp","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"xrkQVtB9iGZvxqph":3,"s4dpkteY6EHat95Y":3},"flags":{"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"traceRune":{"id":"EN5JvXSqvF0eW6Tr","onDelete":"detach"},"invokeRune":{"id":"iNNjPNrrglELcqpz","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e-playtest-data.impossible-playtest-class-features.Item.P7WEtnFBMzO3ZYAE","duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.8.0","createdTime":1734821075808,"modifiedTime":1734821075808,"lastModifiedBy":"s4dpkteY6EHat95Y"},"_id":"6EoYbMlDXZdhy7bo"},{"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/core/icons/equipment/shield/round-wooden-boss-gold-brown.webp","name":"Shield Block","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Shield Block} general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>"},"rules":[{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.jM72TjJ965jocBV8","flag":"shieldBlock"}],"slug":"shield-block","_migration":{"version":0.935,"lastMigration":null,"previous":null},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["champion","druid","exemplar","fighter","inventor"],"rarity":"common"},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder Player Core","authors":"","license":"ORC","remaster":true},"level":{"value":1},"category":"classfeature","onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":"ADSFx6Ws5ucaBsbJ"},"type":"feat","_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.eZNCckLzbH3GyncH","duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.8.0","createdTime":1734821075808,"modifiedTime":1734821075808,"lastModifiedBy":"s4dpkteY6EHat95Y"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":200,"ownership":{"default":0,"s4dpkteY6EHat95Y":3},"flags":{"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"shieldBlock":{"id":"HOng5YLStgbbH7Jp","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"_id":"6hymdantK5MkjSpf"},{"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/core/icons/sundries/books/book-eye-purple.webp","name":"Wizard Spellcasting","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>Through dedicated study and practice, you can construct spells with academic rigor by shaping arcane magic. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h2>Spellbook</h2>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Tome of Silent Shadows</em> or something more academic, like <em>Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory</em>.</p>\n<p>The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school).</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to and learn via Learn a Spell.
