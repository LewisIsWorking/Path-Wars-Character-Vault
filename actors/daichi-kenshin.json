Whether they pass unseen among other peoples or hold their tails high, kitsune are clever observers of the societies around them.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Kitsune are shapechangers with two forms: one of a fox-headed humanoid and one largely depending on where they were raised. Those raised in populated areas typically have what's called a tailless form—a humanoid body without any fox features that resembles a more common ancestry, such as an elf or a human. In wooded or rural areas, their second form is more likely to be that of a fox.</p>\n<p>Though all-kitsune settlements exist, most live among people of other ancestries, granting them a degree of external insight into social rules or dynamics that others process only subconsciously. Kitsune enjoy subverting expectations as much as they do going along with them. Their fondness for jokes, stories, and wordplay, especially when the twist of a riddle hinges on the listener's assumptions, reinforces their reputation as tricksters.</p>\n<p>With dual forms and a connection to both the material and spiritual worlds, kitsune have diverse concepts of self and identity. Some even view their forms as separate individuals altogether, using them to explore different aspects of their personality.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character with innate magical talents and countless hidden facets, each revealed with a glint of the eye and a twisting grin, you should play a kitsune.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Studiously observe the habits of those around you, taking mental notes on how to imitate them better.</li>\n<li>Delight in jokes, clever wordplay, pranks, or unnecessarily complex plots.</li>\n<li>Present a different, but authentic, side of yourself in each new situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are taken in by your magnetic personality and enigmatic nature.</li>\n<li>Marvel at your many supernatural abilities.</li>\n<li>Wonder what you aren't telling them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kitsune have alert vulpine ears, pointed snouts, and short, semi-retractable claws on their fingers and toes. Their fur is dense, countershaded, and most often red,tan, black, or white in color. Kitsune have bushy tails that grow in number as they hone their innate magical abilities, to as many as nine.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Kitsune are rarely the majority in whatever communities they inhabit, and many go their whole lives without meeting another kitsune beyond their family. Their society, as much as it exists, centers primarily around the commonalities that kitsune find as they pass among other peoples. The same social perspective that helps them imitate others also makes them quick to notice signs that someone may need help or a kind word. Due to this, kitsune often form strong interpersonal relationships and tend to anchor their social circles.</p>\n<p>When two kitsune do meet, they may find themselves exchanging light verbal repartee, enjoying the sport of trying to outwit each other. While it's considered a grave offense to outright give away another kitsune's shapechanging nature, kitsune relish surreptitiously forcing another to \"break character,\" shocking the other into disrupting their transformation through a well-placed comment.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Kitsune often have neutrality in their alignment from balancing their dual natures, though their instinct for stirring up trouble leads many to lean slightly toward chaos. Some possess the ability to control or bend the will of others, but even among those that do, only the evilest use these arts flippantly or selfishly.</p>\n<p>The patron kitsune deity is Daikitsu, the goddess of crafting and agriculture. Though not all kitsune necessarily worship Daikitsu, most respect her as the purported source of their powers. Kitsune in Tian Xia often revere both Shizuru and Tsukiyo, seeing the duality of the sun and moon in their own multifaceted nature. A small sect of Avistani kitsune worship Sivanah, the goddess of illusion, respecting her position between perception and reality and believing the goddess's true form to be that of a kitsune-hidden behind not seven veils, but nine.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>While kitsune have some traditional names, they're more likely to use names that are unremarkable in their local society, the better to pass unnoticed. Some have different names for each form: a kitsune name for their kitsune form, a regional name for a tailless form, and possibly no name at all for a fox form.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Hamako, Haohiko, Kitsukou, Kon, Kwan-la, Talaro</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Kitsune Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Because your spells per day are limited, you often rely on trusty, carefully chosen cantrips and focus spells. When necessary, you know how to win a fight without magic.</p>\n<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>\n<p>Your education and breadth of experience make you knowledgeable about many subjects. You can contribute information related to your scholarly pursuits, especially about magic.</p>\n<h2>While Exploring...</h2>\n<p>Your flexibility means you might look for magical auras, remain on guard, or even sneak around. Your ability to fill different niches means that your role often depends on the talents of the other members of your group.</p>\n<h2>In Downtime...</h2>\n<p>You split your time between magical pursuits, like researching spells and crafting items, and martial practice, such as retraining combat abilities to learn new techniques.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Continually refine your spell and item selections to suit your personal style, or prepare battle plans and spell lists for a variety of situations.</li>\n<li>Socialize with scholars of magic and veteran combatants alike, seeking out masters to teach you new techniques.</li>\n<li>Overreach with ambitious plans that pull you in too many directions at once.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Wonder how you can keep on top of two disparate disciplines at the same time.</li>\n<li>Believe you have a broad enough skill set to take care of yourself in most situations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a magus, you can draw replacement sigils with the tip of your weapon or your free hand for spells requiring material components, replacing them with somatic components instead of needing a material component pouch. At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-level spell and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below). Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a magus, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 2-2: Magus Spells per Day. Because you split your focus between physical training and magical scholarship, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest level and, if you can cast 2nd-level spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 level lower than your highest spell level. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a magus. For example, as a 1st-level magus, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level magus, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<h3>Spellbook</h3>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of eight arcane cantrips and four 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be anything from a sturdy book with a secure latch entitled Theses on the Stratagems of Supernatural Warfare to a tattered collection of training pamphlets with your name scrawled on the cover.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level of spell you can cast. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures. Though you lose some lower spell slots as you increase in level, you keep the spells in your spellbook and can prepare them in your higher-level slots as normal.</p>\n<p>If you have a spellbook from multiple sources (such as being a magus with the Wizard Dedication feat), you can use the same spellbook for all your spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The studious spells class feature gives you extra slots of this level for specific spells.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spellstrike</h2>\n<p>You've learned the fundamental magus technique that lets you combine magical and physical attacks together. You gain the Spellstrike activity.</p>\n<h3>Spellstrike Specifics</h3>\n<p>Though the base Spellstrike rules cover most spells, various modifications apply to more complicated spells when loaded into your fist, blade, or other attack.</p>\n<p><strong>One Target</strong> The spell targets only the target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets. Some feats let you affect more creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Reach</strong> The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, shocking grasp would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with reach, and ray of frost would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Ancillary Effects</strong> Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and tanglefoot's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Defenses</strong> Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones.</p>\n<p><strong>Invalid or Immune Target</strong> If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Variable Actions</strong> Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take exactly 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Metamagic</strong> You typically can't use metamagic with Spellstrike because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.</p>\n<h2>Arcane Cascade</h2>\n<p>After you wield magic, you can enter a special stance to make your attacks more effective.</p>\n<h2>Hybrid Study</h2>\n<p>Your extensive physical training and carefully chosen magic combine to form a unique and dangerous fighting style that's more than the sum of its parts. You choose one field of hybrid study to represent your particular combination of skills. Your hybrid study gives you a special ability, usually tied to Spellstrike or Arcane Cascade, and it determines your initial conflux spell. The hybrid studies presented in this book are as follows.</p>\n<h3>Inexorable Iron</h3>\n<p>Once you begin along a path, nothing can stop you from reaching its end. You transform the mass of a greataxe, greatsword, or polearm into an unstoppable force to augment your own striking power or keep you standing on the battlefield. When you enter Arcane Cascade stance and at the start of each of your turns while you're in that stance, if you're wielding a melee weapon in two hands, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to half your level (minimum 1 temporary HP).</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> thunderous strike</p>\n<h3>Laughing Shadow</h3>\n<p>Magic is freeing, a means to your ends, and you can use it to go where you want, do as you please, and avoid the consequences. You are a laughing shadow of spell and blade, always one step ahead of your foes, always with a trick up your sleeve.</p>\n<p>While in Arcane Cascade stance, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds, or a +10-foot bonus if you're unarmored. If you have a free hand while in the stance and are attacking an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} creature, you increase the extra damage to 3, to 5 if you have weapon specialization, or to 7 if you have greater weapon specialization. You must have your other hand completely free; the extra damage doesn't apply if you have a free-hand weapon or other item in that hand, even if you would normally be able to use the hand for other things.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> dimensional assault</p>\n<h3>Sparkling Targe</h3>\n<p>You've studied the applications of magic, training yourself to perform not just offensive maneuvers but defensive tactics as well. When magic flows through you, your shield can block impossible things, even a dragon's breath or a magic missile.</p>\n<p>You gain the Shield Block general feat.</p>\n<p>When you're in Arcane Cascade stance with your shield raised, your circumstance bonus to AC from your shield also applies to your saves against spells and other magical effects. In addition, damage you take as a result of a spell or magical effect while you're in Arcane Cascade can trigger your Shield Block reaction, even if the damage isn't physical. When blocking damage in this way, increase your shield's Hardness by an amount equal to the extra damage from Arcane Cascade (typically 1, but 2 if you have weapon specialization, or 3 if you have greater weapon specialization). These benefits apply whether you're using an actual shield, the shield spell, or something else that works like a shield (such as a raised tome if you have the Raise a Tome feat).</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> shielding strike</p>\n<h3>Starlit Span</h3>\n<p>With magic, the sky's the limit, and you can't be bound by the confines of physical proximity. Your power reaches as far as your senses can perceive, transcending the space between you and your target even with spells that normally require direct physical contact.</p>\n<p>When you use Spellstrike, you can make a ranged weapon or ranged unarmed Strike, as long as the target is within the first range increment of your ranged weapon or ranged unarmed attack. You can deliver the spell even if its range is shorter than the range increment of your ranged attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> shooting star</p>\n<h3>Twisting Tree</h3>\n<p>The staff is perhaps one of the simplest of weapons, but this simplicity belies its elegance and versatility. To you, a staff is casting implement and martial weapon alike-the foundation of a fighting style.</p>\n<p>While you wield a staff in one hand, the staff adjusts in shape and weight, gaining the agile trait and increasing its damage die size to 1d6. While you wield a staff in both hands, it lengthens, twists, and reshapes, gaining the parry, reach, and trip traits. While you're in Arcane Cascade stance, you can Interact or Release to change your grip on the weapon as a free action when you Strike with your staff, including Strikes made in a Spellstrike. This happens before you roll your attack roll. You can also Interact to change your grip on the staff as a free action triggered at the end of your turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> spinning staff</p>\n<h2>Conflux Spells</h2>\n<p>You learn a conflux spell from your hybrid study, and you can cast additional conflux spells by selecting certain feats. Conflux spells are magus-specific spells created for combat and are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to both study your spellbook and perform a physical regimen.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points.</p>\n<h2>Magus Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a magus class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to increase ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Studious Spells<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your hybrid study grants you additional spells that can enhance your power in combat. You gain two special 2nd-level studious spell slots, which can be used to prepare spider climb, true strike, water breathing, and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. You add any spells from this class feature to your spellbook. At 11th level, the extra slots increase to 3rd level and you add haste and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. At 13th level, the extra slots increase to 4th level and you add fly and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study.</p>\n<p><strong>Laughing Shadow</strong> 7th: mirror image; 11th: shift blame; 13th: dimension door</p>\n<p><strong>Sparkling Targe</strong> 7th: resist energy; 11th: warding aggression; 13th: stoneskin</p>\n<p><strong>Starlit Span</strong> 7th: darkvision; 11th: wall of wind; 13th: freedom of movement</p>\n<p><strong>Inexorable Iron</strong> 7th: enlarge; 11th: earthbind; 13th: dimensional anchor</p>\n<p><strong>Twisting Tree</strong> 7th: magic mouth; 11th: slow; 13th: blink</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You can inflict greater injuries with your favored weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your fundamental understanding of magic improves, making your spells harder to resist. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to defend yourself better against incoming attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to a wide range of ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You fortify your spells with masterful prowess. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to avoid blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmed defense, increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Double Spellstrike<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You can extend the magic of spells you store with Spellstrike. After you make a Spellstrike with a spell cast from a spell slot, you retain an echo of the spell, stored in your body. The next time you Spellstrike, you can cast the same spell again without expending a spell slot.</p>\n<p>If you choose to cast a different spell with Spellstrike, or you go 1 minute without using the stored spell, the stored spell dissipates harmlessly.</p>"},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.attacks.weapon-base-rapier.rank","value":1},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.attacks.weapon-base-sap.rank","value":1},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.attacks.weapon-base-shortbow.rank","value":1},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"system.proficiencies.attacks.weapon-base-shortsword.rank","value":1},{"domain":"all","key":"RollOption","option":"class:magus"}],"slug":"rogue","_migration":{"version":0.935,"lastMigration":null,"previous":{"schema":0.935,"foundry":"12.331","system":"6.7.2"}},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":[],"rarity":"common"},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder

Some feats let you affect more creatures.</p>\n<p>Reach: The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, shocking grasp would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with reach, and ray of frost would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Ancillary Effects</strong> Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and tanglefoot's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Defenses</strong> Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones. Invalid or Immune Target: If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Variable Actions</strong> Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take exactly 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Metamagic</strong> You typically can't use metamagic with Spellstrike because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.</p>"},"rules":[{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.QDW9H8XLIjuW2fE4","flag":"spellstrike"}],"slug":"spellstrike","_migration":{"version":0.935,"lastMigration":null,"previous":{"schema":0.935,"foundry":"12.331","system":"6.7.2"}},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["magus"],"rarity":"common"},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder Secrets of Magic","authors":"","license":"OGL","remaster":false},"level":{"value":1},"category":"classfeature","onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":"JiqzapPokAbfgCWp"},"type":"feat","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.KVj5ofUwu3VJSrVw"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":{"spellstrike":{"id":"SlwuZO48X67OetCW","onDelete":"detach"}}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":700,"ownership":{"default":0,"mbblqnGJEWUAQNoo":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.16.1","coreVersion":"12.327","createdTime":1718129882174,"modifiedTime":1718129882174,"lastModifiedBy":"mbblqnGJEWUAQNoo","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.KVj5ofUwu3VJSrVw","duplicateSource":null},"_id":"tD94l6SqtuuHgMxx"},{"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/core/icons/environment/settlement/watchtower-silhouette-yellow.webp","name":"Deny Advantage","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p><strong>Barbarian</strong> Your foes struggle to pass your defenses.
