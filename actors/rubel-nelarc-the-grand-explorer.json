Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea. Human characters can be any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Human Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Two free ability boosts</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

While the other gods toiled away to create the world, she set her sights on the heavens, placing each star in the sky. After surveying her artistry, she hung the brightest star high in the north and made it her home. Her first gift to mortals was this beacon of hope, a twinkling sign in the dark sky that they could turn to when lost or unsure of themselves. Desna provides safe passage through the darkness to all, should they choose to follow.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Most adventurers pay at least some homage to Desna, for who wouldn't want a little luck in a scrape, a straighter path to a fascinating discovery, and sweet dreams at the end of a journey? The ancient goddess of the stars naturally attracts a large contingent of followers among Firebrands. Whether a Firebrand prays for inspiration when composing a ballad about their exploits or invokes the name of the goddess for good fortune at the gambling table, Desna's worship plays a central role in the lives of many in the organization.</p>\n<p>Mariners in the Firebrands, whether they are privateers sinking corrupt merchant vessels or members of Vidrian's navy, frequently place themselves in Desna's care. Desnan sailors often refer to the goddess as the Lady of the North, and every ship's navigator, no matter how worldly, recites prayers to her as they make celestial observations based on Cynosure, her home in the North Star. The goddess's shipbound followers typically show their allegiance by wearing flowing sashes of blue and white or by having a butterfly or star tattooed on the back of their hand. Mariners exploring new sea routes are particularly precious to Desna, and devout voyagers often find that clouds break just in time for important navigational sightings or that light from twinkling jellyfish highlights reefs and shoals for sailors to avoid disaster.</p>\n<p>Whether on land or sea, Firebrands devoted to Desna are typically demonstrative worshippers. With the goddess's symbol added between the crossed swords of their Firebrand marks, they wave banners and lead hymn circles at gatherings, often sponsoring performance contests in the goddess's name. Martial followers etch butterflies onto the blades of their weapons or hang star-shaped charms from their pommels.</p>\n<p>In addition to their garments, Firebrand followers of Desna identify each other based on their unique practices and sayings. The night before beginning a journey, such worshippers will scan the twilight sky for the first star that appears, taking it, and the constellation it appears in, as an omen for the voyage. An older Firebrand might tell an errant first mark, \"Find your place in the sky\" or \"Watch whither you wander.\" Firebrand astrologers put particular weight on the transit of the planets, and they see comets and shooting stars as powerful omens. Upon parting, two Desnans might exchange the farewell \"Fortune favor your friends\" and the response \"And founder your foes.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> aid fellow travelers, explore new places, express yourself through art and song, find what life has to offer</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> cause fear or despair, cast nightmare or use similar magic to corrupt dreams, engage in bigoted behavior</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> dreams, luck, stars, and travelers</p>"},"rules":[],"slug":"desna","_migration":{"version":0.935,"lastMigration":null,"previous":{"schema":0.935,"foundry":"12.331","system":"6.7.2"}},"traits":{"otherTags":[]},"publication":{"title":"Pathfinder Lost Omens: Firebrands","authors":"","license":"OGL","remaster":false},"category":"deity","sanctification":{"modal":"can","what":["holy"]},"domains":{"primary":["dreams","luck","moon","travel"],"alternate":["star","void"]},"font":["heal"],"attribute":["cha","dex"],"skill":["acrobatics"],"weapons":["starknife"],"spells":{"1":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.o4lRVTwSxnOOn5vl","4":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.A2JfEKe6BZcTG1S8","5":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.y0Vy7iNL3ET8K00C"}},"type":"deity","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.JgqH3BhuEuA4Zyqs"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"mbblqnGJEWUAQNoo":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.12.9","coreVersion":"12.327","createdTime":1686166995525,"modifiedTime":1686166995525,"lastModifiedBy":"mbblqnGJEWUAQNoo","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.JgqH3BhuEuA4Zyqs","duplicateSource":null},"_id":"97KQI68Hvrbtp0vH"},{"_id":"uhe2qE2IX18XojIk","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/equipment/weapons/rapier.webp","name":"Rapier(affixed rime crystal)","system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>The rapier is a long and thin piercing blade with a basket hilt.
