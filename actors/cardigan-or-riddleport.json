First, it doesn't conjure a generic nameless facsimile of a creature to be your minion as long as you Sustain the effect. Instead, it conjures one of your eldamon for 2 rounds, allowing your eldamon to charge up and use one elemental power. On the turn you incarnate them, your eldamon partially phases in adjacent to you and Steps, Strides, or takes another action corresponding to a type of movement it has (such as Swim for a water eldamon or Fly for an air eldamon). At the end of your next turn, the eldamon spends two actions to use one of their two-action powers of your choice. The incarnation then ends and your eldamon phases out.</p>\n<p>While partially phased in briefly due to an incarnation, your eldamon isn't fully present. In this state, they can't take any other actions except the ones mentioned above, but in exchange for this restriction, they also can't be targeted or harmed by any effects except those that would be able to end or disrupt a spell effect (such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.9HpwDN4MYQJnW0LG]{Dispel Magic}). Hypothetical effects that can harm even a fully phased-out eldamon can still affect an incarnated eldamon, but normally there's nothing a phased-in creature can do that would accomplish that. While partially phased in, your eldamon isn't solid enough to block other creatures' movement, just like when the eldamon is phased out.</p>\n<p>Due to the restrictions and the intense strain on the eldamon compared to a full phase, many eldamon trainers don't learn how to perform an incarnation. Those that do so use it to quickly pivot by incarnating one eldamon and then phasing in another on their next turn.

While out of phase, you can't act (unless you have an ability that specifically allows you act while phased out).</p>\n<p>While phased in, your eldamon uses your initiative and gains actions and reactions at the start of each of your turns, rather than you. Your eldamon must remain within 160 feet of you, so since you can't act to move, that significantly restricts its range of movement. It feels unpleasant for a phased-in eldamon to stay outside of line of effect from you, as the steady of line of effect is calming. As such, they refuse to do so unless it is necessary during an encounter or similar life or death situation, as determined by the GM. Your eldamon can use Phase Eldamon in order to switch back the phase to you as a free action, rather than a two-action activity. With your permission, they can also use Phase Eldamon to swap briefly back to you and then over to another eldamon, which is a two-action activity as normal. When they do so, the new eldamon appears adjacent to you or adjacent to the previous eldamon, whichever the previous eldamon chooses.</p>\n<p>The phase shift lasts until your eldamon uses Phase Eldamon, or until your eldamon is reduced to 0 Hit Points, whichever comes first. When your eldamon returns the phase back to you (even if it does so only briefly when shifting to a different eldamon), you lose Hit Points equal to the eldamon's missing Hit Points, and you take all other negative effects the eldamon was suffering. Additionally, when it phases back out, your eldamon refreshes. If losing the eldamon's missing Hit Points reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you become dying 1 as normal (or dying 2 if the eldamon was reduced to 0 Hit Points by a critical hit or a critical failure on a saving throw). If you reach 0 Hit Points for any reason, your eldamon phases out and you phase in.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> During an encounter, you can Phase Eldamon as a free action, triggered at the start of your turn, as long as you started the encounter without an eldamon phased in and haven't used Phase Eldamon or Incarnate Eldamon yet in the encounter. If you do, you can use the elemental effusion ability first.</p>"},"rules":[],"slug":"phase-eldamon","_migration":{"version":0.935,"previous":{"schema":0.926,"foundry":"12.331","system":"6.8.1"}},"traits":{"otherTags":[],"value":["concentrate","eldamon-trainer"]},"publication":{"title":"Battlezoo Eldamon","authors":"","license":"ORC","remaster":true},"actionType":{"value":"action"},"category":"interaction","actions":{"value":2},"deathNote":false},"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/actions/TwoActions.webp","ownership":{"default":0,"NXRvKATlfzBSvs5S":3,"71SxMCtnCABLtFjn":3},"flags":{"core":{},"pf2e":{"grantedBy":{"id":"GGGi0DhdWzs5vBsQ","onDelete":"cascade"}}},"_stats":{"compendiumSource":"Compendium.battlezoo-eldamon-pf2e.actions.Item.MEhjM8VvmsgbnOX8","duplicateSource":null,"coreVersion":"12.331","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"6.8.1","createdTime":1736680082027,"modifiedTime":1736680082027,"lastModifiedBy":"71SxMCtnCABLtFjn"},"sort":300000,"_id":"2bAwtFrbJTcZknxZ"},{"folder":null,"name":"Tug Conduit","type":"action","effects":[],"system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute (this frequency applies across all your eldamon)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> Your eldamon has not used Tug Conduit since they phased in.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your eldamon tugs on the conduit they share with you, dragging you toward them.
